###1. Build design systems

I love to build scalable design systems from the ground up such as the work I did for [Hellocar](/hellocar). I like this because you start with the bare building blocks of an experience and you build upon it.

###2. Multi-disciplined team

The success or the failure of a product never comes down to if you had the best designer or the best developer. It comes down to how the team works together and delivers the product and this was true with the team in [LateRooms](/Laterooms). Working in an Agile/SCRUM framework.

###2. Experiments and Validation

I believe getting something in front of users helps to validate ideas quickly and cheaply but I also believe this gives you the chance to be bold and challenging. A good example is a work I did for [Cambridge Audio.](/cambrdige-audio).
