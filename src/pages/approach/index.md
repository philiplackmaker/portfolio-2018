###1. Build design systems

Building scalable design systems from the ground up is one of my favourite tasks, for example, the work I did for [Hellocar](/hellocar). This is valuable to both the business and the product. By starting with the fundamentals I believe you can then build on those blocks making into a strong foundation on which you can create a design language that develops as it iterates.

Getting something in front of users helps to validate ideas quickly and cheaply. It is vital for successful product development, but I also believe you should be bold and challenging to the users. A good example is the work I did for [Cambridge Audio.](/cambrdige-audio)
