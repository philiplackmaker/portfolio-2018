I wanted to add a section even though I am one person and much of my influnces of the way I work comes from the people around me and the companies I worked.

I don't think my any of these approaches are new or diffrent but these are the methodlolgy I belive make great products.
(This is version 1 of my approach)

###1. Great products come from great teams
The success or the failure of a product never comes down to if you had the best designer or the best developer. It comes down to how the team works together and delivers the product.

###2. Expereiment on your users
UCD approach is cleary the best way to understand the right things to build but don't be affarid to take risks with your users.

###3. I love design systems

###4. Challange the patterns
