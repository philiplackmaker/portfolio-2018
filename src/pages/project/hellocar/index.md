###The Problem

[Founders Factory](https://foundersfactory.com/) identified a business model that they could replicate in the UK market. The model was to create a marketplace to buy and sell used cars. They wanted to replicate other successful business such as [Beepi](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/07/used-car-marketplace-beepi-shuts-down-outside-of-ca-merges-with-stealth-fair-com/) (this went bust 3 months in ðŸ¤¨) and also [Carspring](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/rocket-carspring/) (This also went bust). [They raised lost of money from some big players in the UK start-up scene.](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/11/uks-hellocar-secures-1m-to-to-disrupt-uk-car-buying-market/?guccounter=1)

##Getting the MVP out

When I joined there was a goal by the business to get an MVP out as quick as possible. This pressure came from investors wanting to see R.O.I. Founders Factory created a proof of concept but this was more smoke and mirrors than an actual product. Taking the great work Founders Factory I created a product for real users.

###Brand and positioning

One of my tasks was to create a brand for the service. I was well aware that we were going to work with a branding agency to create a new brand, with that in mind I created a lean brand (I spent an afternoon on it) so we had something to build the product with.
<br><br>
In hindsight, this might not have put us in the best position for success. Hello car is different to an S.A.S.S product, buying a car is one of the biggest purchases you going to make and if you going to make this online without seeing the car you need to have trust in the brand.

###Landing page v1

This was one of the hardest pages to design; no assets, no imagery, no positioning and no value proposition.
<br><br>
My desire was to move away from the standard start-up landing page in hindsight this may have made the task harder. As boring as the pattern is it does works because users are familiar that hierarchy and layout of information. We are asking users to do something they have never done before (buying a car online that they have not seen or touched) should we also challenge them with a progressive visual language.
<br><br>
I tried multiple ways of explaining the model and the value including putting a 3D car in a box ðŸ˜œ.

###MVP

##Beyond the MVP
###Design process

Deciding what we would build next ultimately was controlled by the head of the product my role was to give him the right information to make an informed decision.
<br><br>
This data would come from multiple sources; user testing sessions and analytic tools. In hindsight, we should have made the majority of decisions on analytics. Qualitative data came over quantitive data.
<br><br>

###Rebrand

The initial brand was created by me but it was a lean brand. We had feedback that does not reassure a customer to purchase a car online so we needed a rebrand. We worked with the brilliant [Nomad](http://www.nomadstudio.com/) who helped to elevate the brand to something people trusted. Taking what they created I then moved it into a scalable digital system.
<br><br>

###Design system

Taking the work that nomad created I geeked ðŸ¤“ out within the sketch and created a symbol system and library so that anyone who designed for the product had all the building blocks to make a feature.

##Outcome

Hellocar was not a success and did not get past seed round. [I wrote a short piece about what may of caused the failure of Hellocar.](/why-did-hellocar-fail)
