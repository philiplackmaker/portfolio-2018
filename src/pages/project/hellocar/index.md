###The Problem

Founders Factory identified a business model that they could replicate in the UK market. The model was to create a market place to buy and sell used cars. They wanted to replicate other successful business such as Beepi (this went bust 3 months intü§®) and also Carspring (F\*%K this also went bust‚Ä¶is it a sign). They raised a load of money from some big players in the start-up world.

##Getting the MVP out there

When I joined there was a goal by the business to get MVP out as quick as possible this pressure came from investors wanting to see R.O.I. Founders Factory created a proof of concept but this was more smoke and mirrors than an actual product.

###Brand and positioning

One of my tasks was to create a brand for the service. I was well aware that we were going to work with a branding agency to create a new brand, with that in mind I created a lean brand (I spent an afternoon on it) so we had something to build the product with.

In hindsight (I might be saying this work a few times) this might not of put us in the best postion for success. Hellocar is different to a S.A.S.S product buying a car is one of the biggest purchases you going to make and if you going to make this online without seeing the car you need to have trust in the brand.

###Landing page v1

This was one of the hardest pages to design; no assets, no imagery, no positioning and no value prop. Just my ‚Äòlean visual language‚Äô my work was cut of for me.

My desire was to move away from the standard start-up landing page in hindsight this may of made the task harder. As boring as the pattern is it does works because users are familiar that hierarchy and layout of information. We are asking users to do something they have never done before (buying a car online that they have not seen or touched) should we also challenge them with a progressive visual language?!?!

I tried multiple ways of explain the model and the value including putting a 3D car in a box üòú
(F.Y.I this was not my idea)

MVP

"If You're Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You‚Äôve Launched Too Late" -
This was the mantra the business said when anyone asked us about the product. (maybe not the best way to got you team feeling positive)

##Beyond the MVP
###Design process

Deciding what we would build next ultimately was controlled by the head of product my role was to give him the right information to make an informed decision.

This data would come from multiple sources; user testing sessions, Fullstory, and analytics. In hindsight we should of made the majority of a decisions on analytics, qualitative came over quantitive data.

Getting the experts in

The current brand was created by me and it was too cute to reassure a customer to purchase a ¬£10,000 car online. We worked with the brillant Nomad who helped to elevate the brand to something people believed in. I took what they create and moved it into a digital system. Unfortunately this may of been too little to late.

###Design system

Taking the work that nomad created I geeked out on sketch and created a symbol system so that anyone who designed a feature for the product had all the building blocks to make a feature.

###Final product

These are some of the key screens that we created.

##Why did it Fail?

Hellocar failed üò± over the last year I have had lots of time to reflect on why it failed and where my responsibility fell into it.

###Change in business model

When I joined I was presented with a model that was looking to disrupt the car industry with a new way of buying cars; think Auto-trader but with steroids. The business (CEO and Head of product) decided to pivot on this model they felt that it would need to much effort and time to get these cars onto the platform. The model moved closer and closer to a traditional used car to the point we were going to use investors money to buy cars.

###Team changes

Personally I felt the business was moving away from an area that excited me and to a traditional used car dealer but with a fancy website so I decided to move on. The business decided to increase the runaway so decided to reduce the development this had a big effect on the rest of the team and on team morale. Then the CEO/founder decided to step down S\*\*T really hit the fan.

###Supply and choice

One of the biggest challenges to Hellocar was solving the supply chain. At first we had a bunch of cars from Hertz that we launched MVP with but the problem with these cars is that they did not mach a user profile they were cars Herts was looking to shift we had a ¬£30k mustang for instance. We had an opportunity to work with Mini to list car their cars pre going to auction‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we got 30 diesel Mini‚Äôs just at the time when diesel was not getting the best PR

At our peak we had around 40 cars compare that with Autrotrader‚Äôs 400,000 cars and you can see we lack the choice (unless you wanted a yellow diesel).

We made an assumption that the product (the website) and service is more important than the cars. This is not true people want the right car for the right person if its gets delivered that is an added benefit but benefit needs to be weighed up against if its petrol or diesel, if it has leather seats or fabric. The customer needs to weigh up if the benefit of the experience of purchasing is more important than the long term experience of a the car.

###Effort

I believe that our effort was not always focused in the best way to sell cars. We built features that took time and no one used. We needed to validate the feature and build it in the leanest version we could to test it.
Two key examples of this is; Filters we spent two sprints building a filter system that was scalable and could handle having 400,000 cars but we only had 40 cars did we need this feature.
We built a checkout flow for users to get car loans something that we could of handled with a form and doing it over the phone. We spent two sprints working on this and we only got one customer purchasing in this way. Where we put effort should of been based on data not assumptions and opinions.

###Personal Learnings

These could of been the reasons but it could of been a multiple of others; CEO leaving, tech team leaving, no marketing, weak brand for first 6 months etc. I guess what ever does not kill you makes you stronger ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
