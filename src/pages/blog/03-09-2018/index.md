[Hellocar](/hellocar) failed üò± over the last year I have had lots of time to reflect on why it failed and where my responsibility fell into it.

###Change in business model

When I joined I was presented with a model that was looking to disrupt the car industry with a new way of buying cars; think Auto-trader but with steroids. The business decided to pivot on this model they felt that it would need too much effort and time to get these cars onto the platform. The model moved closer and closer to a traditional used car dealership.

###Team changes

Personally, I felt the business was moving away from an area that excited me and to a used car dealership so I decided to move on. The business decided to increase the runaway so decided to reduce the development team. This had a big effect on the rest of the team and on team morale.

###Supply and choice

One of the biggest challenges to Hellocar was solving the supply chain. At first, we had cars from Hertz that we launched the MVP with but the problem with these cars is that they did not match a user profile the service was aimed at. The cars Herts was looking to sell were ¬£30k mustang, not ¬£8k Ford Focus. We had an opportunity to work with Mini to list their cars before going to auction. The cars we got were 30 diesel Mini‚Äôs just at the time when diesel was not getting the best PR as the government did a U-turn on the environmental issues of diesel.

At our peak we had around 40 cars compare that with Autrotrader‚Äôs 400,000 cars and you can see we lack the choice (unless you wanted a yellow diesel mini).

We made an assumption that the product (the website) and service are more important than the cars. This is not true, people want the right car for them if it gets delivered that is an added benefit but benefit needs to be weighed up against if its petrol or diesel or if it has leather seats or fabric. The customer needs to weigh up if the benefit of the experience of purchasing is more important than the long-term experience of the car.

###Effort

I believe that our effort was not always focused on the best way to sell cars. We built features that took time and no one used. We needed to validate the feature and build it in the leanest version and learn how they perform.
<br><br>
Two key examples of this are; Filters we spent two sprints building a filter system that was scalable and could handle having 400,000 cars but we only had 40 cars so did we need this functions of the feature.
<br><br>
We built a checkout flow for users to get car loans something that we could have handled with a form and doing it over the phone. We spent two sprints working on this and we only got one customer purchasing in this way. Where we put effort should have been based on data, not assumptions and opinions.

###Personal Learnings

These could have been the reasons but it could have been a multiple of others; CEO leaving, tech team leaving, no marketing, weak brand for first 6 months, Cars are too high ticket items etc. I guess whatever does not kill you makes you stronger ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
