This is two popular UX methods to solving a design solution to a problem they both have some similarities and some differences. I have experienced both types and seen both postives and negatives of the approach. In this post, I am going to highlight what works and what does not and finally how I have built my own workshop based on them.

###Lean UX
This is the approach of validating product ideas in the leanest possible way. The idea comes from Jeff Gothelf book 'Lean UX'. It follows a **Build > Test > Learn** approach.

###How does it work

- Running Experiments to validate ideas.
- Learning and testing from your end user.
- Hypothesis-driven development.

###Good points

- Get a solution in-front of users quickly and learn from that.
- Start to understand a backlog. As you create all the assumptions of what you think the product is these helps to priorities the risky ones which you then test but it also maps out all the other things the product should be.
- Research is light and you use the idea of just enough testing.
- Focusing on the crucial parts of the experience that will make or break the product. Then testing these assumptions and learning from them.
- Slots nicely into a SCRUM methodology.

###Bad points

- The language you use can be intimidating to people
- Within the book, the sketching and ideation approach is the weakest part.
- The hypothesise need metrics to validate if they are a success it can be hard to create them based on user testing and they become a bit â€˜woollyâ€™.
- The pace you move out you sometimes you can miss assumptions

##Design Sprints

This is based on the book â€œDesign Sprintsâ€™ by Jake Knapp. Jake Knapp worked at Google Ventures where he created this approach. It follow a **unpack > ideate > evaluate > test > refine pattern** approach.
###How does it work

- The DIY breaks the approach into a 5-day Sprint.
- Day 1 unpack the problem > Day 2 idea solutions > Day 3 Decide the solution > Day 4 Prototype > Day 5 test the solution

###Good points

- Clients love this approach, they are involved and they all get a say.
  -They also get an internal prototype that they can circulate for buy-in.
- Its a really fun week with a good output and great for team building.
- Research is light and you use the idea of just enough testing.
- The structure of the week is very well defined
- The sketching day is excellent and the exercises you do to get people out of their comfort zone is perfect.
- Really understand the problem from the clients point of view.

###Bad Points

- The prototyping day is pretty intense
- You donâ€™t get a well-defined backlog. You need to do extra work to pull them together for a backlog.
- It does not fit into SCRUM and it almost makes the design process waterfall.ðŸš¿

##Conclusion
I enjoy using both of these techniques and have used them at the start of projects to understand what to build. Lately, I've combined bits of both exercises into one with the focus on getting a prototype in front of users. This is my workshop approach and is something I continue to iterate and build upon.

- **Unpacking problem** (stolen from design sprints). I ask key stakeholders to speak about the problem and what they are trying to solve
- **Understand your users**, get in their shoes what they are trying to do and achieve. I usually use a version of the empathy map for this
- **Vision** why are we building this and how will it benefit the business. I usually use the Vision board but I am starting the create my own version as there is an overlap with the empathy map which I have found clients find frustrating.
- **Assumptions** (stolen from lean UX) I love this exercise its a great way of getting everyone's belief what this product should be. After that, I map out on a matrix to understand which is a high priority and high risks. Which I then look to test.
- **Sketch** I find the sketching framework of the design sprint the best approach to get the ideas out. You can read the process here.
- **Prototype** I usually look to have two days to build a lean prototype we usually use Invsion and make it a simple click through but I have built HTML/CSS prototypes in the past.
- **Test** Conducting testing with actual users ideally I would not run the test but that never happens
