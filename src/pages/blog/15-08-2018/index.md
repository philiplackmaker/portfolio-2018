üëãüèª Weclome to my new blog and site üëãüèª
<br><br>
This is the first blog I have had running om my site and this is the first proper. I wanted to start the blog with writing about building this site but if you search for ‚ÄòBuilding your Gatsby site‚Äô, there is loads of blog posts written by proper developers about how they did it so if you want to learn more of the processs.
<br><br>
**I recommend these resources which helped me as this post will probably not help you solve a GraphQL problem.**
<br><br>

- [Gatsby.org](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site is great and has loads of really good [tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) on how to start building a site with gatsby.
- [LevelUp Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE) was the main resource for me to understand Gatsby they are great and really easy to follow
- I found this [post](https://codebushi.com/using-gatsby-image-version1/) really useful to understand how to get images to work
  <br>
  (I am going to update this as I find more useful references)
  <br><br>
  Since about 3 years ago I could not really code but from designing sites and working developers I started to understand more of the principles of how to they build software. My way in to this magical world of development was via General Assembly which really helped me. Whilst living in Australia I did the HTML/CSS course and this really made me understand development.
  <br><br>
  Now with this mountain of knowledge and the fact my personal website was non-existant I built my first portfolio site from scratch. Let‚Äôs say my first site was basic but it worked.
  <br>

  <br><br>
  The problem with this site was it was a pain to make changes to. Everything was hard-coded so if I wanted to make a change I would have to do it on every page nothing was built programatically. It did its job but it was time for it to retire (it might still be live as I have not moved the new site to my domain)
  <br><br>
  Fast forward to today well actually about 4 months ago I decided to embark on building a new site. There was some driving factors to this; some new projects that I want to show, I want to focus more on the process and learnings and less on the viusal output and finally I wanted to challanged my technology understanding.
  <br><br>
  My first step was to whip up a design I wanted to created a lean system as I know I tweak and change it within the browser. The design system was simple 3 colors, two type face (Saliec and GT-Super) and the 'doodle deisgn elelment'.
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  The next step was to decide on what tech stack to use and this is when I stumbled on [üòçGatsbyüòç](https://www.gatsbyjs.org). In a nutshell Gatsby builds your website from your data source (markdown, CMS etc) and using a bunch of cool tech to make you life easier it builds the site for you built on the React. I had a basic understanding of react and this project allowed me to take it my understanding further.
  <br><br>
  With Gatsby you can host and deploy it on what ever platform you want. I have used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to do the deployment; Netlify then connects to a Github repo so when you push to master (or what ever you say you repo is) it triggers a deployment to the live site. Netlify also has a bunch of cool features that means that you don‚Äôt need to actually programme (my favourite way to do development. The [Contact us form](/about) is powered by Netlify so I did not have to do any logic or backend to store the information.
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
  The next part is [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) ü§ì which has been the hardest part to get my head around. If you want to use information from your data source and use it on your site you need to run queries on that data and to pull it on the page. GraphQL lets you run queries in realtime and also allows you to use API‚Äôs to effect that data.
  <br><br>
  So this is an example of GraphQL query I am running on the about page.
  <br><br>

```graphql
query AboutByPath($id: String!) {
  markdownRemark(id: { eq: $id }) {
    html
    frontmatter {
      path
      title
      templateKey
      cover_image {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid(
            maxHeight: 1200
            duotone: { highlight: "#4644FD", shadow: "#222172", opacity: 65 }
          ) {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<br><br>
I want to breakdown this query down further specifically `cover_image`.
<br><br>

```graphql
cover_image {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid(
            maxHeight: 1200
            duotone: { highlight: "#4644FD", shadow: "#222172", opacity: 65 }
          ) {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
```

<br><br>
In this part of the query I am pulling `cover_image` from my markdown (_Example of the Markdown_ `cover_image: "phil-3.jpg"`) this is just an image file I have declared in the file. The next part is I am asking the query to use an API to run some tasks on the query. I want to scale the image for breakpoints and also place a colour overlay over the image. To do this I want to exposes several image processing GraphQL functions built on the Sharp image processing library using the plugin `gatasby-transformer-sharp`. Firstly `Fluid` function which means my image will be resized for breakpoints and within that I run ‚Äòduotone‚Äô which will then apply colouring overlay to the image. If you want to learn more about `gatasby-transformer-sharp` [read this out](https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/)
<br><br>
**Final result!** The image is now scaled to my different breakpoints and it is also coloured.
<br><br>

The next steps with this site (you could even call it a backlog)

- Build the Blog landing page
- Build new functionality on the blog, Social, Comments, Tags
- Re-design the "Approach' page
- Build the presenter mode
- Add Global search to the site
- Write more blog posts
