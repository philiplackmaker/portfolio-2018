The business (CEO and Head of product) decided to pivot on this model they felt that it would need to much effort and time to get these cars onto the platform. The model moved closer and closer to a traditional used car to the point we were going to use investors money to buy cars.</p>\n<h3 id=\"team-changes\"><a href=\"#team-changes\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Team changes</h3>\n<p>Personally I felt the business was moving away from an area that excited me and to a traditional used car dealer but with a fancy website so I decided to move on. The business decided to increase the runaway so decided to reduce the development this had a big effect on the rest of the team and on team morale. Then the CEO/founder decided to step down S**T really hit the fan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"supply-and-choice\"><a href=\"#supply-and-choice\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Supply and choice</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges to Hellocar was solving the supply chain. At first we had a bunch of cars from Hertz that we launched MVP with but the problem with these cars is that they did not mach a user profile they were cars Herts was looking to shift we had a ¬£30k mustang for instance. We had an opportunity to work with Mini to list car their cars pre going to auction‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ we got 30 diesel Mini‚Äôs just at the time when diesel was not getting the best PR</p>\n<p>At our peak we had around 40 cars compare that with Autrotrader‚Äôs 400,000 cars and you can see we lack the choice (unless you wanted a yellow diesel).</p>\n<p>We made an assumption that the product (the website) and service is more important than the cars. This is not true people want the right car for the right person if its gets delivered that is an added benefit but benefit needs to be weighed up against if its petrol or diesel, if it has leather seats or fabric. The customer needs to weigh up if the benefit of the experience of purchasing is more important than the long term experience of a the car.</p>\n<h3 id=\"effort\"><a href=\"#effort\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Effort</h3>\n<p>I believe that our effort was not always focused in the best way to sell cars. We built features that took time and no one used. We needed to validate the feature and build it in the leanest version we could to test it.\n<br><br>\nTwo key examples of this is; Filters we spent two sprints building a filter system that was scalable and could handle having 400,000 cars but we only had 40 cars did we need this feature.\n<br><br>\nWe built a checkout flow for users to get car loans something that we could of handled with a form and doing it over the phone. We spent two sprints working on this and we only got one customer purchasing in this way. Where we put effort should of been based on data not assumptions and opinions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"personal-learnings\"><a href=\"#personal-learnings\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Personal Learnings</h3>\n<p>These could of been the reasons but it could of been a multiple of others; CEO leaving, tech team leaving, no marketing, weak brand for first 6 months etc. I guess what ever does not kill you makes you stronger ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/why-did-hellocar-fail","title":"Why did hellocar fail?","templateKey":"blogpost","cover_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAYAAAGOmu97AAAACXBIWXMAAAPoAAAD6AG1e1JrAAAB8UlEQVQoz3WQzU8TYRCH9x/1pgcuetAQCRql2xa0hEIrH5KVQFPpJ7Sl0JYiFrq1u92yu/0geACJxKgxJGpMrYVSHt824WLi4Zd5f/NOZp4ZqWb30Iw2SuwYqdGAfkLKJr7iH09TyP3CLHcIBd4jHdahUb+mLqKm/qZa/oP03JNE2+3icoR4KiuEwiZSpXrBcuYcebKA27NJ9qXNs5Et8ntnLCo7jIztMBvYQjowutQtMEU0jSv63jYhvfGRhg0Hla7QJZJtX9MUc48OoVhuUdZb9GmrVpet+CeC6VNKhuBp1GB4rsn9J5vMT2ZwL1r4H8SIZnVGb8eYCxS5JQeRfN4883KUjfXP6G97KAsaKW+BSMJieixCav0UNd8WjILhhmXAKHhqwm/nvgz8DbdUF6P7jNniT3IrTXKZb4TWzlDftTEF557WQokfEw4eUdr/Lm4JutkhGT3BOZTkzsMEL1Ztdvd+cM+3jeSdyhCLNNEqF6wEPzDhWMPpDjM3o7I8a+EYjuKQUyj+IrEFE0McYGrpNY9cM/jvRvC4ksieVww9HmVkOi9WKfcwNUjET1gNHWEI38/page92MEodbF0eJM9x+dO4XZGmBhPsKRU2C+0RN0FFfUSS/SoiLdkWz36ssyrgW78vxr8CR02GKz9v9q/enALugfWXUkAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":2.5100346020761246,"src":"/static/hellocar-blog-hero-578bad61f0dd2642235cf8a14e096fa5-2e892.png","srcSet":"/static/hellocar-blog-hero-578bad61f0dd2642235cf8a14e096fa5-437b2.png 1255w,\n/static/hellocar-blog-hero-578bad61f0dd2642235cf8a14e096fa5-5d8b6.png 2510w,\n/static/hellocar-blog-hero-578bad61f0dd2642235cf8a14e096fa5-2e892.png 3627w","sizes":"(max-width: 3627px) 100vw, 3627px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"decca9d3-4bc0-56a8-826c-6ccbe92bc768"}}
