I was well aware that we were going to work with a branding agency to create a new brand, with that in mind I created a lean brand (I spent an afternoon on it) so we had something to build the product with.\n<br><br>\nIn hindsight (I might be saying this work a few times) this might not of put us in the best postion for success. Hellocar is different to a S.A.S.S product buying a car is one of the biggest purchases you going to make and if you going to make this online without seeing the car you need to have trust in the brand.\n<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"landing-page-v1\"><a href=\"#landing-page-v1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Landing page v1</h3>\n<p>This was one of the hardest pages to design; no assets, no imagery, no positioning and no value prop.\n<br><br>\nMy desire was to move away from the standard start-up landing page in hindsight this may of made the task harder. As boring as the pattern is it does works because users are familiar that hierarchy and layout of information.
