Lately, I've combined bits of both exercises into one with the focus on getting a prototype in front of users. This is my workshop approach and is something I continue to iterate and build upon.\n<br><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unpacking problem</strong> (stolen from design sprints). I ask key stakeholders to speak about the problem and what they are trying to solve</li>\n<li><strong>Understand your users</strong>, get in their shoes what they are trying to do and achieve. I usually use a version of the empathy map for this</li>\n<li><strong>Vision</strong> why are we building this and how will it benefit the business. I usually use the Vision board but I am starting the create my own version as there is an overlap with the empathy map which I have found clients find frustrating.</li>\n<li><strong>Assumptions</strong> (stolen from lean UX) I love this exercise its a great way of getting everyone's belief what this product should be. After that, I map out on a matrix to understand which is a high priority and high risks. Which I then look to test.</li>\n<li><strong>Sketch</strong> I find the sketching framework of the design sprint the best approach to get the ideas out. You can read the process here.</li>\n<li><strong>Prototype</strong> I usually look to have two days to build a lean prototype we usually use Invsion and make it a simple click through but I have built HTML/CSS prototypes in the past.</li>\n<li><strong>Test</strong> Conducting testing with actual users ideally I would not run the test but that never happens</li>\n</ul>","transformer-remark-markdown-ast-c5e47854d2908c71903241437e8996cb-gatsby-remark-autolink-headersgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-external-links-":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"link","title":null,"url":"/hellocar","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hellocar","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":2,"offset":2},"end":{"line":2,"column":10,"offset":10},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":22,"offset":22},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":" failed 😱 over the last year I have had lots of time to reflect on why it failed and where my responsibility fell into it.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":22,"offset":22},"end":{"line":2,"column":145,"offset":145},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":2,"column":145,"offset":145},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"children":[{"type":"link","url":"#change-in-business-model","title":null,"data":{"hProperties":{"aria-hidden":true,"class":"anchor"},"hChildren":[{"type":"raw","value":"<svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg>"}]}},{"type":"text","value":"Change in business model","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":4,"offset":150},"end":{"line":4,"column":28,"offset":174},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":147},"end":{"line":4,"column":28,"offset":174},"indent":[]},"data":{"id":"change-in-business-model","htmlAttributes":{"id":"change-in-business-model"},"hProperties":{"id":"change-in-business-model"}}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"When I joined I was presented with a model that was looking to disrupt the car industry with a new way of buying cars; think Auto-trader but with steroids.

The customer needs to weigh up if the benefit of the experience of purchasing is more important than the long-term experience of the car.</p>\n<h3 id=\"effort\"><a href=\"#effort\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Effort</h3>\n<p>I believe that our effort was not always focused on the best way to sell cars. We built features that took time and no one used. We needed to validate the feature and build it in the leanest version and learn how they perform.\n<br><br>\nTwo key examples of this are; Filters we spent two sprints building a filter system that was scalable and could handle having 400,000 cars but we only had 40 cars so did we need this functions of the feature.\n<br><br>\nWe built a checkout flow for users to get car loans something that we could have handled with a form and doing it over the phone. We spent two sprints working on this and we only got one customer purchasing in this way. Where we put effort should have been based on data, not assumptions and opinions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"personal-learnings\"><a href=\"#personal-learnings\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Personal Learnings</h3>\n<p>These could have been the reasons but it could have been a multiple of others; CEO leaving, tech team leaving, no marketing, weak brand for first 6 months, Cars are too high ticket items etc. I guess whatever does not kill you makes you stronger 🤷🏻‍♂</p>","transformer-remark-markdown-ast-7338a63332202a2f36f5ced760bcac2f-gatsby-remark-autolink-headersgatsby-remark-copy-linked-filesgatsby-remark-prismjsgatsby-remark-imagesgatsby-remark-external-links-":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"👋🏻 Weclome to my new blog and site 👋🏻\n","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":43},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"html","value":"<br>","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":1,"offset":43},"end":{"line":3,"column":5,"offset":47},"indent":[]}},{"type":"html","value":"<br>","position":{"start":{"line":3,"column":5,"offset":47},"end":{"line":3,"column":9,"offset":51},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nThis is the first blog I have had running on my site and this is the first proper.

I wanted to start the blog with writing about building this site but if you search for ‘Building your Gatsby site’, there are loads of blog posts written by proper developers about how they did it so if you want to learn more of the process.\n<br><br>\n<strong>I recommend these resources which helped me as this post will probably not help you solve a GraphQL problem.</strong>\n<br><br></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gatsby.org</a> site is great and has loads of really good <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tutorials</a> on how to start building a site with Gatsby.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LevelUp Tutorials</a> was the main resource for me to understand Gatsby they are great and really easy to follow</li>\n<li>I found this <a href=\"https://codebushi.com/using-gatsby-image-version1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">post</a> really useful to understand how to get images to work\n<br><br></li>\n</ul>\n<p>3 years ago I could not code but working closely with developers at ustwo I started to understand the principles of development, this made me want to learn. The way I understood development was doing a General Assembly HTML/CSS course this really helped me grasp development.\n<br><br>\nNow with this mountain of knowledge and the fact, my personal website was non-existent I built my first portfolio site from scratch.

The site was hard-coded so if I wanted to make a change I would have to do it on every page nothing was built programmatically. It did its job but it was time for it to retire the site.\n<br><br>\nFast forward to today well actually about 4 months ago I decided to embark on building a new site. There were some driving factors to this; some new projects that I want to show, I want to focus more on the process and learnings and less on the visual output and finally, I wanted to challenge my technical understanding.\n<br><br>\nMy first step was to whip up a design I wanted to create a lean system as I know I tweak and change it within the browser. The design system was simple 3 colors, two typefaces (Saliec and GT-Super) and the 'doodle design element'.\n<br><br>\n\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1080px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 57.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"New Website design\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/website-design-c16c98e44fc0cd05f9c46294e7f46468-e2462.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/website-design-c16c98e44fc0cd05f9c46294e7f46468-f6591.png 270w,\n/static/website-design-c16c98e44fc0cd05f9c46294e7f46468-cce5f.png 540w,\n/static/website-design-c16c98e44fc0cd05f9c46294e7f46468-e2462.png 1080w,\n/static/website-design-c16c98e44fc0cd05f9c46294e7f46468-4a68c.png 1600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<br><br>\nThe next step was to decide on what tech stack to use and this is when I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">😍Gatsby😍</a>. In a nutshell Gatsby builds your website from your data source (markdown, CMS etc) and using a bunch of cool features to make your life easier it builds the site for you built on the React. I had a basic understanding of react and this project allowed me to take it my understanding further.\n<br><br>\nGatsby allows you to host and deploy on whatever platform you want. I used <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netlify</a> to do the deployment; Netlify then connects to a Github repo so when you push to master (or whatever you repo is) it triggers a deployment to the live site. Netlify also has a bunch of cool features that means that you don’t need to actually programme (my favourite way to do development). The <a href=\"/about\">Contact us form</a> is powered by Netlify so I did not have to do any logic or backend to store the user's details.\n<br><br>\n\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1080px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 77.62906309751435%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Tech Stack diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/Diagarms-blog-03-f85798d3a14002da7466059e5b4c7552-e2462.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/Diagarms-blog-03-f85798d3a14002da7466059e5b4c7552-f6591.png 270w,\n/static/Diagarms-blog-03-f85798d3a14002da7466059e5b4c7552-cce5f.png 540w,\n/static/Diagarms-blog-03-f85798d3a14002da7466059e5b4c7552-e2462.png 1080w,\n/static/Diagarms-blog-03-f85798d3a14002da7466059e5b4c7552-b1cf7.png 1620w,\n/static/Diagarms-blog-03-f85798d3a14002da7466059e5b4c7552-fdd07.png 2092w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<br><br>\nThe next part is <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GraphQL</a> 🤓 which has been the hardest part to get my head around. If you want to use information from your data source and use it on your site you need to run queries on that data to pull it on the page. GraphQL lets you run these queries in real-time and also allows you to apply API’s to effect that data.\n<br><br>\nThis is an example of GraphQL query I am running on the <a href=\"/about\">about page</a>.\n<br><br></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\"><span class=\"token keyword\">query</span> AboutByPath<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token variable\">$id</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> String<span class=\"token operator\">!</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  markdownRemark<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token attr-name\">id</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">eq</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token variable\">$id</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    html\n    frontmatter <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      path\n      title\n      templateKey\n      cover_image <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        childImageSharp <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          fluid<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"token attr-name\">maxHeight</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">1200</span>\n            <span class=\"token attr-name\">duotone</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">highlight</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#4644FD\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">shadow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#222172\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">opacity</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">65</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n          <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>GatsbyImageSharpFluid\n          <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><br><br>\nThis is a breakdown of the query, specifically <code class=\"language-text\">cover_image</code>.\n<br><br></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"graphql\"><pre class=\"language-graphql\"><code class=\"language-graphql\">cover_image <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        childImageSharp <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          fluid<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"token attr-name\">maxHeight</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">1200</span>\n            <span class=\"token attr-name\">duotone</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">highlight</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#4644FD\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">shadow</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"#222172\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">opacity</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">65</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n          <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>GatsbyImageSharpFluid</code></pre></div>\n<p><br><br>\nIn this part of the query, I am pulling <code class=\"language-text\">cover_image</code> from my markdown for the about page. (<em>Example of the Markdown</em> <code class=\"language-text\">cover_image: &quot;phil-3.jpg&quot;</code>).This is just an image file I have declared in the markdown. The next part I am asking the query to use a plugin to run some tasks on that query. I want to scale the image for breakpoints and also place a colour overlay over the image. To do this I want to expose several image processing GraphQL functions built on the Sharp image processing library using the plugin <code class=\"language-text\">gatasby-transformer-sharp</code>. Firstly <code class=\"language-text\">Fluid</code> function which means my image will be resized for breakpoints and within that I run ‘duotone’ which will then apply colouring overlay to the image. If you want to learn more about <code class=\"language-text\">gatasby-transformer-sharp</code> <a href=\"https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">read this</a>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Final result!</strong> The image is now scaled to my different breakpoints and is also coloured.\n<br><br>\n\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;

After that, we then used the <a href=\"https://www.romanpichler.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roman Pincher product vision board</a> and created one for the Evo system.\n<br><br>\nWe spent the following day gathering all the assumptions we believed was true for the product and mapped them on a assumption matrix.

Hello car is different to an S.A.S.S product, buying a car is one of the biggest purchases you going to make and if you going to make this online without seeing the car you need to have trust in the brand.\n<br><br>\n\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-308ac.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1080px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 70.66508313539191%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Hellocar style tile v1\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-e2462.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-f6591.png 270w,\n/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-cce5f.png 540w,\n/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-e2462.png 1080w,\n/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-b1cf7.png 1620w,\n/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-781d5.png 2160w,\n/static/hellocar-style-tile-v1-fb085fe95d0fc68ffca770758343be1b-308ac.png 2526w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3 id=\"landing-page-v1\"><a href=\"#landing-page-v1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Landing page v1</h3>\n<p>This was one of the hardest pages to design; no assets, no imagery, no positioning and no value proposition.\n<br><br>\nMy desire was to move away from the standard start-up landing page in hindsight this may have made the task harder.
