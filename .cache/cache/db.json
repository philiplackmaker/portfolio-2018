We decided the best way was to gather quantitive research; to do this we run a survey and broadcasted it on our social channels to.  </p>\n<p>We run the survey for about a week and got 175 response with a good mix of ages and demographics.  We distilled down the findings into key insights </p>\n<ol>\n<li>The set-up of the speaker is vital, it needs to be timely and easy. It’s the first touchpoint for the customer so it needs to be simple and positive. </li>\n<li>The supporting app is important to users. The application gives you the opportunity to be intelligent, delightful but must not be intrusive. </li>\n<li>Customers don’t want to be in a walled garden with their speaker. They have multiple sources and they want to choose how they listen to music.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Building the right thing</h2>\n<p>Working with senior members of the Cambridge Audio team we looked to gain a shared understanding of the problem and the users. During the first day we started with an empathy map to get under the skin of the segments. After that we then used the Roman Pincher product vision board and created one for the Evo system. </p>\n<p>We spent the following day gathering all the assumptions we believed the product is/does/feels/looks like and mapped them on the assumption matrix. We focused on the riskiest and the highest priority assumptions.

Whilst we created the storyboard we mapped all the hypothesis that we created in the previous day - this made sure that we had the right tests we wanted to validate. </p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-cfcaa.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 1080px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Sketching\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-918ac.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-2ceef.jpg 270w,\n/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-b59aa.jpg 540w,\n/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-918ac.jpg 1080w,\n/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-419dc.jpg 1620w,\n/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-6e912.jpg 2160w,\n/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-6194f.jpg 3240w,\n/static/cambrdige-audio-sketching-b750a6add1c9b5407f859688d7dfb6b9-cfcaa.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<h3>Prototype</h3>\n<p>Our next focus was to create a prototype to validate with users if our hypothesis are correct or not. (To do create a prototype). As some of our hypothesis could not be tested in the prototype we ran another survey.</p>\n<h2>Design, <del>build,</del> test</h2>\n<p>The second stage of the work was to create the product that would be built. Unfortunately this project had to be ran waterfall :shower: as the in-house development team would not be ready to build this. </p>\n<p>We had morning stand-ups and a weekly review to make sure their was alignment but this would never be the same as an Agile/Scrum software development. :thumbsdown:</p>\n<h3>Design decisions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The app should be a supporting experience most of the time people will control via their preference music player </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Set-up should be timely and get them to the music as soon as possible </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calibration should be simple and quick - reduce steps as much as possible</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Mapping the product</h3>\n<p>Taking all the information from the testing the first step was to map out the whole product and to understand what would be the MVP could be. We used the story mapping technique and created all tasks the user would need to do.</p>\n<h3>Design system</h3>\n<p>Working closely with the visual designer Taavet Kelle my role in this part was to lead and guide the visual language. Taavet created a system for both the iOS and Android we decided to create a visual language that felt natural within each platform utilise interaction models and visual language of the platform (type, shadows etc). </p>\n<h3>Final Product*</h3>\n<p>*This is what we hope it to look like </p>\n<h2>Outcomes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Thanks a lot, it was such a valuable month for us, (and me personally) The whole lean approach is the biggest goal for me and we’re slowly getting everyone thinking that way. You were all a great help in reinforcing that\" <br>\n<strong>-Chris Saunders Product Manager for Cambrdige Audio</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the product has not been released I don’t have data on the success of the product. </p>\n<!-- ###Learning\nUnfortunately this product was waterfall which goes against my belief that the best products are made into multi-discipline teams. \n\nWhen doing workshops with clients that don’t understand Lean UX it would be good to spend time outlining the process. -->"}
